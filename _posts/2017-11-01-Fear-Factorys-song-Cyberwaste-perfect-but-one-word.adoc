= Fear Factory’s song Cyberwaste; perfect, but one word.

So here is this song of one of the great American metal bands who started in the 90’s. It is hard to say what genre of metal they play, well you can say it comes between thrash metal and industrial metal, but if anyone asks me about what industrial metal is, I find it hard to explain it in words, hope you can relate to me in similar experiences. 😀

Alright, so the song is, Cyberwaste – the video made in Perth Australia; edge of the world they say, and of course it is. (: And the song starts with the lyrical note – “Nothing you say matters to us”.

Being a powerful metal band, singing powerful songs, I find it hard to explain that I felt a bit of agonising wonder within me and not fascination. Don’t know exactly who wrote this song but why the word “us” is being used in a sentence which is inclined to explain that the listener is annoyed or scared in a way of someone or a whole lot in particular. The word “us” is used which denotes fear and being a pu**y, because one only brings together other people when he is threatened of his self-righteousness in the bounds of societal norms which are being created by some disgusting people earlier in the centuries and people are rigidly following that throughout the ages and even if someone tries to rebel (subtly) he is threatened and put to self-questionable matters of belief, identity and truth. So, in the song if the song writer would have put the word “I”, then according to me it would have denoted that even if the person is threatened, he is being strong and is taking it like a man, standing with firm belief in whatever he believes and would have said, “Nothing you say matters to me”. Look! The sentence looks strong in itself.
